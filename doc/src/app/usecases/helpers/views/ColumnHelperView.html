    <h1>ColumnHelper</h1>

    <p class="description">This <i>AgGrid</i> related helper, assists with the creation of columns. If you are using the <i>InlineSearch</i> feature, it will also help wrap your cell renderers with the correct code to display inline search.</p>
    <p class="description">The goal of the ColumnHelper is to facilitate the setup of <i>AgGrid</i> in a streamlined manner. It's easier to start with a "Demo". The example code is here a full setup of a rather complex table in <i>CDR</i>, which covers many of the features of the helper. Some features in this is also using the <i>GridHelper</i></p>

    <h2>Demo</h2>

    <p class="description">This may seem like a long example, but it helps visualize that even though it's long, setting this up in a general non-helper way would be much, much longer and much harder to do and look at.</p>
