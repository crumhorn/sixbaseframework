    <h1>ToolbarHelper</h1>

    <p class="description">This <i>Toolbar</i> related helper, assists with the creation of buttons and items for the <i>Toolbar</i></p>
    <p class="description">The goal of the ToolbarHelper is to facilitate the setup of the <i>Toolbar</i> in a streamlined manner. It's easier to start with a "Demo". The example code is here a full setup of a rather complex table in <i>CDR</i>, which covers many of the features of the helper. This example uses images, but you can of course use web fonts or images both or separately.</p>
    <p class="description">Please take note of the <i>GridToolbarHelper</i> helper that deals with toolbar functions related to <i>AgGrid</i>. They are in a separate class so that dependencies are kept separate in case <i>AgGrid</i> is not in use.</p>

    <h2>Demo</h2>
    <pre><code [highlight]="usageCode" language="ts"></code></pre>

    <p class="description">This may seem like a long example, but it helps visualize that even though it's long, setting this up in a general non-helper way would be much, much longer and much harder to do and look at.</p>
